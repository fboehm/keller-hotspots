```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
path_to_results <- "~/Box Sync/attie/keller-hotspots/results"
```

First, how many results files do I have?

Now, let's count the files in our subdirectories.

```{bash}
cd ~/Box\ Sync/attie/keller-hotspots/results/
cd pvl-run-99011; ls | wc
cd ../pvl-run-99111; ls | wc
cd ../pvl-run-99211; ls | wc
cd ../pvl-run-99311; ls | wc
cd ../pvl-run-99411; ls | wc
```

From the submit files for these jobs, I submitted this many jobs per submit file:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r table_jobs}
run <- c(99011, 99111, 99211, 99311, 99411)
number_of_jobs <- c(666, 2628, 3321, 136, 1326)
hotspot_chr <- c(5, 7, 9, 13, 2)
```

From the above bash outputs, we see that I'm missing no files. YAY!
